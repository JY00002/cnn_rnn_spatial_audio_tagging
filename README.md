# cnn_rnn_spatial_audio_tagging
This source code is for the paper "convolutional gated recurrent neural network incorporating spatial featues for audio tagging"

It is also an implement for CLDNN (CNN-LSTM-DNN), recurrent convolutional neural network or convolutional recurrent neural network. It can be used for regression and also classification. You can adapt it to your task easily.
